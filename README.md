### Project Overview 

The Emergency Room Dashboard Data Analysis project aims to leverage data-driven insights to enhance the efficiency, resource allocation, and overall performance of an emergency room (ER) within a healthcare facility. By implementing a comprehensive dashboard, this project seeks to empower healthcare professionals, administrators, and decision-makers with real-time and historical data to make informed decisions, improve patient outcomes, and optimize the utilization of resources.

### Data Source
The Healthcare Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis was the "Hospital_ER.csv" containing detailed information about healthcare provided by the hospital.

- ### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- - In the initial Data Preparation phase, I performed the following:
    -  1. Data loading and Inspection
    -  2. Handling missing value
    -  3. Data cleaning and formatting

 
  ### Result/ Findings
  
     -  1. Develop a user-friendly dashboard to monitor and analyze emergency room data.
     -  2. Provide real-time insights into patient arrival patterns, waiting times, and satisfaction level.
     -  3. Identify trends and correlations in patient demographics, acuity levels, and medical conditions.
     -  4. Optimize resource allocation by analyzing staff utilization, equipment availability, and room occupancy rates.
     -  5. Enhance decision-making for emergency room management and staff.

  ### Limitations
  
    -  1. Fake healthcare data may not accurately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world healthcare scenarios.
    -  2. Complex patient histories, diverse medical conditions, and nuanced treatment plans may be oversimplified or misrepresented.
